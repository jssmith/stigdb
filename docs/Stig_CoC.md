# StigDB: Code of Conduct v1.0

As part of Stig LLC's ("Stig") commitment to making StigDB a great place to meet and interact with others around the world, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Your commitment to this Code of Conduct in all collaboration channels ensures a positive experience for all our community members. A "collaboration channel" includes message board services, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, and/or other message or communication facilities (including any contents of any of these services or facilities) designed to enable you to communicate with the public at large or with a group.

Specific communities, chats, and message boards may also have additional guidelines which govern your use, so be sure to review them in addition to this Code of Conduct. Stig is not responsible for the content or activities in any user-created, non-Stig managed Communication Service.

All activity on Stig is also governed by the [Stig Terms of Use](tos.md).

## RESPECT OTHERS

We encourage everyone to treat each other with mutual respect. Do not use any communication or collaboration channels to threaten, harass, stalk, or abuse others participating in these services. Stig reserves the right to remove posts that advocate or encourage expressions of violence, bigotry, racism, hatred, or profanity. Stig may remove postings that are deemed inappropriate, offensive or that violate guidelines or this Code of Conduct. Stig may also eject or ban any user from their area who behaves in a manner deemed inappropriate, offensive or who violates guidelines or this Code of Conduct. By participating in the collaboration channels, you agree to be bound to the rules of those areas.

## KEEP IT LEGAL

Stig does not allow any illegal activities. You cannot use the Stig collaboration channels to publish, post, distribute, or disseminate defamatory, infringing, obscene, or other unlawful material or information, specifically, but not limited to, child pornography, bestiality, incest, illegal drugs, software, and harassment. You may not use any of the collaboration channels for the purpose of linking to external sites that violate this Code of Conduct.

Do not upload files or post messages that contain photos, music, software or other material protected by intellectual property laws, rights of privacy or publicity or any other applicable law unless you own or control the rights thereto or have received all necessary consents. Stig is not responsible for any use of anything you say or post.

Do not post any materials (including software and other information) that could harm (or is designed to harm) other users' computers or would allow others to inappropriately access software or web sites.

In addition to upholding this code of conduct, you are responsible for adhering to all local and national laws that pertain to your location.

## PLAY NICE

Stig does not tolerate disruptive activity online, such as persistent off-topic comments and postings or statements that incite others to violate this Code of Conduct or participate in illegal activities. Our participants want to chat and post on our collaboration channels in a positive environment.

Stig does not allow the posting of destructive features, use of computer programs that contain such features, or access to any content that contains destructive features such as: viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or bots, and other activities that can be disruptive to online communication.

Falsely impersonating a Stig community member, agent, or any other person with the intent to mislead or cause harm to others is forbidden.

## DON'T SPAM

Please don't "spam" through our collaboration channels; none of our community like it. To spam includes sending identical and irrelevant submissions to many different discussion groups, mailing lists, chats or communities. Usually such postings have nothing to do with the particular topic of the group or are of no real interest to those on the mailing list. To spam also includes misrepresenting the source of anything you say or post. Spamming and scrolling in chat rooms are serious violations of online etiquette.

Stig reserves the right to ban a user at any time, without notice, from any or all collaborative services for spamming.

## TAKE IT PERSONALLY

The collaboration channels may be used to provide supplemental information regarding your own business (provided you do not use spam to provide this information); however, the collaboration channels are not designed to be used as the primary mechanism for operating your business or providing core information about your business. Any use of our collaboration channels for commercial purposes is solely at your own risk and Stig has no liability for such use.

Any space or account provided to you in any collaboration channel is for your own personal use. You may not sell, license, give away, exchange or barter any space or account provided to you within any collaboration channel for any purpose including, without limitation, selling, licensing, exchanging or bartering space for advertisements.

## ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY

You are responsible and liable for all your activities while participating in any collaboration channel. Remember, you are responsible for anything you say or post and for protecting your own computer system. You are responsible for protecting your computer against interference or viruses that may be encountered on the internet. We recommend you install a virus protection program on your computer.

Our collaboration channels are not designed as the primary places to store any materials; you are responsible for creating backups of materials you post to any collaboration channel such as photos, documents and software. Stig is not responsible for loss of, access to, or deletion or alteration of any materials included in any collaboration channel.

Stig reserves the right to remove at any time, without notice, any sample and/or post to a collaboration channel.
